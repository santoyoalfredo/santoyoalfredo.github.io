            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>
                Music has always been a favorite hobby of mine. I spend much of my time listening to many types
                of music and genres. Picking apart songs and their instruments helps give me a better
                appreciation for the creative process of songwriting and composing. It also serves as a way to
                satiate my curiosity as I listen and identify new harmonic or rhytmic patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I don't play as much as I used to, I did enjoy participating in groups to perform music,
                whether it was as part of a band, choir or orchestra. Those experiences were monumental in
                learning to work with others in order to achieve a common goal.

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>
                Video games are another hobby of mine and have been since I was 5 years old. Over the decades
                the medium has evolved to become an innovative way to tell stories and to inspire others. I
                appreciate and love to admire the work that goes into making such pieces as the landscapes,
                musical score, characters and things behind the scenes such as graphical rendering or
                programming techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                At one point I did aspire to work in the video game industry and that ambition led me to study
                Computer Science. While my desire to create video games lessened my love for the art form
                continues as does my path working with computer programming and software engineering.
